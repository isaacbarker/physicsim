**Welcome to PHYSICSim.**

This project stems from my Physics studies and aims to assist my revision by creating simulations based on the topics I study to allow me to expand me knowledge.

The project makes use of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and is inspired by Daniel Shiffman's [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/). 

If you have any issues or corrections when using the project please open a ticket on Github or email [enquiries@physicsim.co.uk](enquiries@physicsim.co.uk).

I hope you enjoy exploring the project,
