**Welcome to PHYSICSim, interactive and modern Physics simulations.**

This project stems from my Physics studies and aims to assist my revision by creating simulations based on the topics I study to allow me to expand me knowledge.

The project makes use of [p5.js](ttps://p5js.org/) and is inspired by Daniel Shiffman's [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

I hope you enjoy exploring the project.

Isaac.
